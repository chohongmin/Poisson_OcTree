# Poisson Solver on Octree in Parallel Computing
-
The library currently developed by the Ewha University team includes algorithms for Poisson calculations on arbitrary 2D quadtree and 3D octree structures, Hodge-Helmholtz decomposition for fluid, and fluid-solid interaction (FSI) calculations for incompressible fluids and rigid bodies, implemented in C language. Many natural and social phenomena are neither uniform nor consistent in their spatial and temporal scales. This creates a significant demand for quadtree/octree libraries that facilitate efficient scale distribution while being easy and fast to implement. We aim to deploy this library on a supercomputer to solve large-scale FSI problems as well as fluid, electromagnetics, and architectural problems related to Poisson equations. The final implementation of this library is planned to use the Modified Sparse Row (MSR) format, the standard for storing sparse or semi-sparse matrices. This allows us to leverage existing LAPACK/BLAS or comparable linear solvers embedded in supercomputers to efficiently handle linear problems.
